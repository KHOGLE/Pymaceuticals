# Pymaceuticals

Majority of my coding came from class lessons and the pandas or matplotlib documentation sites. For a few various codes I had found in class lessons and the documentation sites, I sought further visual examples on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org.

Human help I recieved for this module came from LA's Sean and Sunshine and tutor Jesse. Sean helped me recenter my overthinking of the scatterplot data gathering, Sunshine pointed out that .sem existed, and tutor Jesse provided guided working out of the for loop and boxplot design.
